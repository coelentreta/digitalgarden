kanār-e-āb khaḌā ḳhud se kah rahā hai koī
gumāñ guzartā hai ye shaḳhs dūsrā hai koī
>The word Kanaar-e-aab can be interpretated in two different ways, first one would be literal i.e. shore of a waterfront or it can be interpretated as someone being on the edge emotionally. 
>While standing at the edge (either of his thought or the water body), he looks at his reflection and whispers to himself, that he doubts whether it is a different person in the reflection of his. He perhaps is caught suddenly by the fact of who he is or has become. The poet is in a way detached from himself and there's a sense of alienation from the self. 
>When we are emotionally distressed we often go to places like a rivershore, the poet also seems to be in such a state perhaps to commit suicide and while rethinking this decision of his he is introspecting and talking to himself ""

havā ne toḌ ke patta zamīñ pe pheñkā hai
ki shab kī jhiil meñ patthar girā diyā hai koī
	Here, the sensitivity of the poet becomes quite apparent because even the falling of a leaf from a tree feels like that someone has thrown a stone in the stillness of the night (jheel), this is just an example of how sensitive the poet is that he is aware, worried and thinking about something as trivial as a leaf falling from a tree, and is so disturbed by it.

	Mai tujhe kaat raha hu aye mere sukhe paudhe 
	mujhse ab titliyon ka dukh nahi dekha jata
	
baTā sake haiñ paḌosī kisī kā dard kabhī
yahī bahut hai ki chehre se āshnā hai koī
	This is also a very good example of how disconnected the poet is from rest of the world, when we care about something or someone we become a bit possessive about those things and when circumstances don't go our way it is quite painful, but here there's almost a submission to the reality without any pushback whatsoever, i.e. he simply accepts the fact that people pretend to care, and his expectations have been so much diminished that he feels that, that in itself is enough. 
	
	Ye kaha ki doshti hai ki bane hai dost naseh 
	Koi charasaz hota koi ghmgusar hota

daraḳht-e-rāh batā.eñ hilā hilā kar haath
ki qāfile se musāfir bichhaḌ gayā hai koī
	Here, the trees are telling the group that someone has been left behind, implying that the absence of the poet isn't noticed by anyone in the group again emphasizing on how much disconnected he already was, even when he was alive. 

chhuḌā ke haath bahut duur bah gayā hai chāñd
kisī ke saath samundar meñ Dūbtā hai koī
	The moon has left him and with moon the shadow of his has also left since there's no shadow without light, the fact that even though when his shadow has left him too, he's still with someone, probably it's the memories of the beloved or he is hallucinating that the beloved(the moon) is still with him. 
	
	Tum mere paas hote ho goya 
	jab koi dusra nahi hota

makān aur nahīñ hai badal gayā hai makīñ
ufuq vahī hai magar chāñd dūsrā hai koī
	The first line gives us a sense of how disconnected from reality the poet has become, i.e. upon seeing the house of the beloved he thought that it's a different house this was maybe because he didn't want to believe that she has left the city or couldn't fathom a world where this has come to pass. Only upon further examination he realizes that this is the same building but she has left. 
	In the second line he has reached the final stage of grief and makes peace with the fact that she has left and accepts this, as the ever changing nature of life. This is masterfully explained that, it's the same sky but the moon is different, perhaps implying to the fact that the moon changes everyday a bit which is also the nature of life. 

fasīl-e-jism pe taaza lahū ke chhīñTe haiñ
hudūd-e-vaqt se aage nikal gayā hai koī 

'shakeb' diip se lahrā rahe haiñ palkoñ par
dayār-e-chashm meñ kyā aaj rat-jagā hai koī
