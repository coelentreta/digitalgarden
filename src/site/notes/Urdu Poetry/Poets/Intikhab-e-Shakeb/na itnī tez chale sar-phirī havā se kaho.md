jahāñ talak bhī ye sahrā dikhā.ī detā hai
mirī tarah se akelā dikhā.ī detā hai

na itnī tez chale sar-phirī havā se kaho
shajar pe ek hī pattā dikhā.ī detā hai
	**Literal**
	The poet is or has become so sensitive that he is worried about the well being of a leaf on a tree. Falling off of a leave is a very trivial and common thing something that doesn't bother us, but since it seems to affect the poet, one can only imagine how sensitive he is.
	**Metaphorical**
	The last leaf might signify something perhaps a last shred of hope or his last breath or his last touch to reality and even a little bit of push/emotional angst can push him over the edge and he will lose his life, mind or both. 


ye ek abr kā TukḌā kahāñ kahāñ barse
tamām dasht hī pyāsā dikhā.ī detā hai
	The poet is clearly overwhelmed and he has lost his will to do anything, this surrender is acknowledged in the limited nature of the cloud and the limitless nature of the desert/barrenness. He is also unable to to make a decision, what to fix and what not to or should he leave everything as it is. We are left with this angst to decide for ourselves. 
	*Kaun is ghar ki dekh bhaal kare 
	roz ek chiz toot jati hai*

vo alvidā.a kā manzar vo bhīgtī palkeñ
pas-e-ġhubār bhī kyā kyā dikhā.ī detā hai

mirī nigāh se chhup kar kahāñ rahegā koī
ki ab to sañg bhī shīsha dikhā.ī detā hai
