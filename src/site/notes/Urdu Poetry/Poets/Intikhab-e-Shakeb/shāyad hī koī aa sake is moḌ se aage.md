kyā kahiye ki ab us kī sadā tak nahīñ aatī
ūñchī hoñ fasīleñ to havā tak nahīñ aatī
	Here it has not been explained the meaning of boundaries, it maybe that the lover is in so intense sorrow that, now even if the beloved tries to come back the boundaries or the walls of sorrow are too high. 
	*Jo teri justajoo mein gawa diya* 
	*uska nemul badal to tu bhi nahi*
	It also maybe the case that the lover has died and now the beloved's sada can never reach him, since the boundary between the dead and the living are simply too high. 

shāyad hī koī aa sake is moḌ se aage
is moḌ se aage to qazā tak nahīñ aatī

vo gul na rahe nik.hat-e-gul ḳhaak milegī
ye soch ke gulshan meñ sabā tak nahīñ aatī

is shor-e-talātum meñ koī kis ko pukāre
kānoñ meñ yahāñ apnī sadā tak nahīñ aatī
	This is the final state of alienation, where he is unable to hear his own sada, he has become so alienated from everything that in the end he has alienated himself too. 

ḳhuddār huuñ kyuuñ aa.uuñ dar-e-ahl-e-karam par
khetī kabhī ḳhud chal ke ghaTā tak nahīñ aatī
	He's pointing out the fact that the farmland does not go where the clouds but rather the clouds come and rain where the farmlands are, even though the farmlands are dependent on the clouds to produce crops and it is inconsequential to the cloud where it rains. Same is the case with him and the beloved the beloved like the cloud can rain where ever she wants, but he is dependent on her like the land on cloud, but still he can't go near her. 
	It can also be argued that the poet is trying to hide his inability to go near her by pawning it off on his self respect.
	
	On the other hand sher of Ghalib is exactly oppposite of this:

		Dil phir tawaf-e-qu-e-malamat ko jaye hai
		Pindaar ka sanam qada veeran kiye huye


us dasht meñ qadmoñ ke nishāñ DhūñDh rahe ho
peḌoñ se jahāñ chhan ke ziyā tak nahīñ aatī

yā jaate hue mujh se lipaT jaatī thiiñ shāḳheñ
yā mere bulāne se sabā tak nahīñ aatī

kyā ḳhushk huā raushniyoñ kā vo samundar
ab koī kiran ābla-pā tak nahīñ aatī

chhup chhup ke sadā jhāñktī haiñ ḳhalvat-e-gul meñ
mahtāb kī kirnoñ ko hayā tak nahīñ aatī
