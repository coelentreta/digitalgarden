muddat huī hai yaar ko mehmāñ kiye hue
josh-e-qadah se bazm charāġhāñ kiye hue

kartā huuñ jam.a phir jigar-e-laḳht-laḳht ko
arsa huā hai dāvat-e-mizhgāñ kiye hue

phir vaz'-e-ehtiyāt se rukne lagā hai dam
barsoñ hue haiñ chaak garebāñ kiye hue

phir garm-nāla-hā-e-sharar-bār hai nafas
muddat huī hai sair-e-charāġhāñ kiye hue

phir pursish-e-jarāhat-e-dil ko chalā hai ishq
sāmān-e-sad-hazār namak-dāñ kiye hue

phir bhar rahā huuñ ḳhāma-e-mizhgāñ ba-ḳhūn-e-dil
sāz-e-chaman tarāzi-e-dāmāñ kiye hue

bāham-digar hue haiñ dil o diida phir raqīb
nazzāra o ḳhayāl kā sāmāñ kiye hue

dil phir tavāf-e-kū-e-malāmat ko jaa.e hai
pindār kā sanam-kada vīrāñ kiye hue
	*The heart once again sets out to circle the street of disgrace,*  
	*Having deserted the temple of pride and self-importance.*
		- The emphasis on dil —the heart—as the one undertaking this journey, rather than the poet himself, suggests a profound loss of agency. The poet appears merely a vessel, compelled to obey the whims and demands of the heart.
		- The use of phir (again) implies repetition—he has walked this path before, fully aware of the humiliation it brings, yet he returns.
		- The phrase tavāf-e-kū-e-malāmat_ is employed masterfully. To others, this street offers nothing but disgrace and rejection. Yet the heart, indifferent to such worldly judgments, drives the poet to circle it as one would the Kaaba—suggesting that the beloved is revered as divine. This inner tug-of-war between heart and reason is a hallmark of Ghalib’s poetry.[[Essays/The internal conflict of Ghalib\|The internal conflict of Ghalib]]
		- In the second line, the poet acknowledges and mourns the abandonment of the temple of pride and self-respect—only to return to the very street where he has been repeatedly humiliated.
		- **In conclusion:**  
		- The poet laments his helplessness before the impulses of the heart. He has, it seems, surrendered entirely to its will.
		- A sher by Meer hassan which talks about this split of self or having another self within himself is-
		*- इतना मालूम तो होता है कि जाता हूँ कहीं*
		   *कोई है मुझ में कि मुझ से लिए जाता है मुझे*
			   Only this much I know—that I am going somewhere. 
			   There is someone/is there someone within me who carries me away from myself.
