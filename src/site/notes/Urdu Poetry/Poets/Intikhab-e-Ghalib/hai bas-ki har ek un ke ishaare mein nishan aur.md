**hai bas-ki har ek un ke ishaare mein nishan aur**
**karte hain mohabbat to guzarta hai guman aur**
*`to such an extent in her every gesture lies another sign`*
*`when she shows affection something else entirely goes through the mind`*

`the beloved always seems to have an alterior motive behind her behavior/acts and hence when she's showing affection to the poet, the idea crosses the mind of the poet that what she might be up to now`

**ya-rab wo na samjhe hain na samjhenge meri baat**
**de aur dil un ko jo na de mujh ko zaban aur**
`oh god they have not yet understood nor will they understand`
`give them more/different heart if i am not being given more/different tongue`

`The term "they"(wo) is plural but it is very common in the classical Ghazal to use such pronouns to refer to the beloved`
`In the first line the poet is lamenting to God that they(the beloved) have never understood me nor will they ever understand my talk, it is also interesting to see how informally Ghalib is talking to the God.`

`In the second line he's asking for divine intervention, because it seems that, that's the only way that the beloved will be able to understand the contents of what he's saying. He's asking for the beloved to be given more heart(i.e. the beloved doesn't have the same quantity of heart as the poet hence she is unable to understand the emotions of his) or different heart(i.e. the heart that the beloved currently possesess is differnt from that of the poet's hence he wants her to be given a similar kind of heart so that she will be able to understand his emotions) or it very might well be the case that the poet doesn't want to accept the rejection hence he's deluding himself that maybe she's unable to understand`

**hai KHun-e-jigar josh mein dil khol ke rota**

**marta hun is aawaz pe har chand sar uD jae**

**pate nahin jab rah to chaDh jate hain nale**
**rukti hai meri taba to hoti hai rawan aur**
*`when they don't find/get a way/path the laments ascend`*
*`when/if my temprament/genius halts it starts to flow even more/differently`*

`This verse speaks to the ability of Ghalib to give masterful metaphors. When a flowing body of water is halted it's level starts to rise, similarly his lamentations are always flowing(this speaks to the kind of pain he's constantly in) and when they are not a given a route to come out they start to get collected and their level rises.`

`In the second line he is telling us what happens once the lamentations start to ascend. When his temprament (i.e. to lament and groan) is halted, it restarts and the now the lamentations have become even more menacing, they might be more menacing because he hasn't lamented in a long time and they have been collected similar to the water body which was halted, when it starts to flow again the stream is much stronger than it was previously, or these lamentations are of a different kind similar to a water body when it's path is halted it might find a different path altogether to flow. `

`Another sher by Ghalib which in my interpretation talks about the state when the laments are about to break free`
`'ghaalib' hamein na chheD ki phir josh-e-ashk se`
`baiThe hain hum tahayya-e-tufan kiye hue`

`In the verse the lamentations of the poet are shown to be relentless, i.e. when they are halted they start to rise until they clear the path or they find a differnet path. If we fixate on what this other path might be, the answer that i got was that he finds a way to express his groans in a more ambiguous way, that is perhaps through sarcasm.`

`The flowing nature of the lamentations also show points towards non-agency, i.e. the poet can't help but lament/groan(one only groans when the pain is unbearable, his constant groaning hints towards the fact that the poet is in unbearable pain all the time). When he tries to gain agency and suppresses the urge to groan they retaliate with a greater force, stripping him of whatever little control he had and leaving him a mere passive entity in his own body, while it has become nothing but a vessel of suffering`

**hain aur bhi duniya mein suKHan-war bahut achchhe**
**kahte hain ki 'ghaalib' ka hai andaz-e-bayan aur**
