**gai wo baat ki ho guftugu to kyunkar ho**
**kahe se kuchh na hua phir kaho to kyunkar ho**

**hamare zehn mein us fikr ka hai nam visal**
**ki gar na ho to kahan jaen ho to kyunkar ho**

**adab hai aur yahi kashmakash to kya kije**
**haya hai aur yahi gu-magu to kyunkar ho**

**tumhin kaho ki guzara sanam-paraston ka**
**buton ki ho agar aisi hi KHu to kyunkar ho**

**ulajhte ho tum agar dekhte ho aaina**
**jo tum se shahr mein hon ek do to kyunkar ho**
	*You get entangled in your mind/thoughts when you look at the mirror*
	*If there were one or two like in the city then why would it be*

	The first question left to interpretation in the first line is why does the beloved get entangled while looking at the mirror (here we are assuming that she's looking at her reflection and not something else), perhaps because she's enchanted and marveling at her own beauty, her beauty is out of this world and hence even though it's herself she feels alienated by it and hence she herself is left in amazement like everyone else, or perhaps she's angry because she doesn't even want her reflection to be as beautiful as she is which in itself would be paradox. This reminds me of a sher by Jaun Elia- 
		*kyun dekhti ho tum aaina*
		*tum to khud se bhi khoobsoorat ho*
	or perhaps she's angered by the fact that the mirror is able to capture her beauty and she feels no thing should be capable of that.

	The second line too posits a question, what would happen if there were one or two more like you in the city, it might be that you (who doesn't even like her reflection to look as good as you) would get in serious altercation with them and might try to drive them away, or maybe the poet is wondering what would happen to the city if there were even one or two more like you, implying that the beloved single-handedly has left the city and him in such a state what would happen if there were more like her. 
	A sher of ghalib where he talks about the damage done to the city just by beloved being in the city is-
		*tum shahr meñ ho to hameñ kyā ġham jab uTheñge* 
		*le ā.eñge bāzār se jā kar dil o jaañ aur*

	Or he might be using "kyunkar ho" in a literal way that why would it be, i.e. trying to assert the improbability or the impossibility of this happening. 

**jise nasib ho roz-e-siyah mera sa**
**wo shaKHs din na kahe raat ko to kyunkar ho**

**hamein phir un se umid aur unhen hamari qadr**
**hamari baat hi puchhen na wo to kyunkar ho**

**ghalat na tha hamein KHat par guman tasalli ka**
**na mane dida-e-didar jo to kyunkar ho**

**batao us mizha ko dekh kar ki mujh ko qarar**
**wo nish ho rag-e-jaan mein faro to kyunkar ho**

**mujhe junun nahin 'ghaalib' wale ba-qaul-e-huzur**
**firaq-e-yar mein taskin ho to kyunkar ho**
