**phir mujhe dīda-e-tar yaad aayā**
**dil jigar tishna-e-faryād aayā**

**dam liyā thā na qayāmat ne hanūz**
**phir tirā vaqt-e-safar yaad aayā**

**sādgī-hā-e-tamannā ya.anī**
**phir vo nairañg-e-nazar yaad aayā**

**uzr-e-vāmāndagī ai hasrat-e-dil**
**naala kartā thā jigar yaad aayā**

**zindagī yuuñ bhī guzar hī jaatī**
**kyuuñ tirā rāhguzar yaad aayā**

**kyā hī rizvāñ se laḌā.ī hogī**
**ghar tirā ḳhuld meñ gar yaad aayā**
    *What a fight will it be with Rizvan*
    *If i remember your house in the heaven*
	The lover seems to be very confident of the fact that he will go to heaven. The beloved for some reason isn't in heaven, it might be because he has died early but also because she is in hell for her karma, it is left for the reader to interpret.

	But it very well might be the case that even in heaven her house is unattainable, think of the ground as the earth and your rooftop as the heaven and the sky as the beloved's house, even if you go to your rooftop(heaven) you are still no more closer to the sky(beloved's house). It very well might be the case that the poet has uplifted the beloved to the stature of God and we know that in Islam there will always be a parda between God and all else
	some couplets which talks about this are- 
		1. Jannat mubarak ho zahidon ko 
		mai aapka saamna chahata hoon
		2. Tu khuda hai na mera ishq farishton jaisa 
		dono insaan hain to kyu itne hizabon me mile

	Or he is implying that it is easier to get into heaven but not into her house. For the poet to get into heaven is also an impossibility but even when that materializes the impossibility of getting into her house doesn't become easier. 

**aah vo jur.at-e-fariyād kahāñ**
**dil se tañg aa ke jigar yaad aayā**

**phir tire kūche ko jaatā hai ḳhayāl**
**dil-e-gum-gashta magar yaad aayā**

**koī vīrānī sī vīrānī hai**
**dasht ko dekh ke ghar yaad aayā**

**maiñ ne majnūñ pe laḌakpan meñ 'asad'**
**sañg uThāyā thā ki sar yaad aayā**

**vasl meñ hijr kā Dar yaad aayā**
**ain jannat meñ saqar yaad aayā**
