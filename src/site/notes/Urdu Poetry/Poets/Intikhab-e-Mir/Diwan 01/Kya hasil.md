ग़म-ए-मज़मूँ न ख़ातिर में न दिल में दर्द क्या हासिल
हुआ काग़ज़-नमत गो रंग तेरा ज़र्द क्या हासिल

Translation:
If there is no sorrow of meaning in your thoughts, and no pain in the heart—what’s the point?
Even if your paper is damp with emotion, and your color is pale—what’s the point?

Interpretation:
Mir is questioning the authenticity of emotion in poetic expression. He’s addressing poets or perhaps even himself. Saying:

> “If your heart doesn't ache and your thoughts aren’t heavy with depth, then that yellowish paper and your pale face are just theatrics. Don’t fool me with damp pages and a tragic look—what matters is inner turmoil, not external display.”



It’s a powerful takedown of superficial expression. He values genuine pain over performative sorrow.

हुए सैद-ए-ज़बूँ हम मुंतज़िर ही ख़ाक जी दे कर
सवारी से किसू की गो उठी अब गर्द क्या हासिल

Translation:
Weak we became, trapped prey—waiting, having already given our soul to dust.
Even if someone’s caravan now raises dust—what’s the point?

Interpretation:
This is the agony of waiting too long. The speaker has exhausted himself waiting for someone—lost strength, given up hope, become saiid-e-zaboon (a helpless prey). And now, when someone finally arrives (raising dust with their mount), it's too late.

> “I’ve already died in my longing. Now that you show up or someone stirs the air—it means nothing.”



This couplet is a lament for delayed love or help. A darkly resigned, “you missed your moment, and I lost mine.”

It reminds me of a similar sher by Faraz:
	*Ab tum aaye ho meri jaan tamasha karne* 
	*Ab to dariya men talatum na sukun hai yun hai*

बला है सोज़-ए-सीना 'मीर' लूँ हो जाएगी जल कर
अगर दिल से उठी तेरे ये आह-ए-सर्द क्या हासिल

Translation:
The burning of my chest, Mir, is already a disaster—I'll burst into flames.
If from your heart rises only a cold sigh—what’s the use?

Interpretation:
Here, Mir sets his own passionate torment (soze-seena) against the beloved’s lukewarm response (aah-e-sard — a cold sigh).
He’s saying:

> “My suffering is blazing, unbearable—your detached response can do nothing to match or soothe it. If all you offer is cold indifference, keep it.”



There’s disdain, but also hurt. The contrast between fiery pain and cold reaction symbolizes emotional mismatch—unrequited love in its most classic Mir-style portrayal.
