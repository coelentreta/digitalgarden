**हम न निकहत हैं न गुल हैं जो महकते जावें
आग की तरह जिधर जावें दहकते जावें**

*Neither are we fragrance nor a rose that spreads its scent as it goes;
Like fire, wherever we move, we burn and blaze.*

**ऐ ख़ुशा-मस्त कि ताबूत के आगे जिस के**
**आब-पाशी के बदल मय को छिड़कते जावें**

*O carefree one, that at your coffin’s front,
instead of sprinkling water, they scatter wine.*

**जो कोई आवे है नज़दीक ही बैठे है तिरे
हम कहाँ तक तिरे पहलू से सरकते जावें**

_*Whoever comes, sits close beside you—_
_how far must we keep sliding away from your side_?*

**_A sher on a similar note:_**

_*Sirak rahin hain meri bastiyaan kinare se_
_vo mujhko bhoolta jaata hai aur mai dekhta hoo_n*

**ग़ैर को राह हो घर में तिरे सुब्हान-अल्लाह
और हम दूर से दर को तिरे तकते जावें**

_Though the line itself states something very simple, it can, however, be read and interpreted in two ways:_

1. The poet laments that unknown people are now welcomed at the beloved’s place, while he (who was once so close) can only gaze at her door from a distance—and even that only while passing by, since if he were to stop near her house, suspicions might arise.
    
    _A sher by Zafar on a similar note:_
    
    _*बात करनी मुझे मुश्किल कभी ऐसी तो न थी_
    _जैसी अब है तिरी महफ़िल कभी ऐसी तो न थी*_
    
    The fact that he passes by but from afar suggests uncertainty. He wishes to go and see her but knows he cannot; at the same time, he cannot stop himself from going to her street, so he maintains his distance. This recalls a sher by Ghalib:
    
    _*दिल फिर तवाफ़-ए-कू-ए-मलामत को जाए है_
    _पिंदार का सनम-कदा वीराँ किए हुए*_
    
    The closed door here implies that he can no longer enter the beloved’s heart.
    
2. The poet may also be complaining, or even taunting, the beloved: nobodies are invited and welcomed into her home, yet he himself has never once been invited. His passing by her house implies that he is always near, yet always excluded. The use of _subhan-allah_ suggests sarcasm, as if mocking the beloved’s behavior.

**वक़्त अब वो है कि इक एक 'हसन' हो के ब-तंग
सब्र-ओ-ताब ओ ख़िरद-ओ-होश खिसकते जावें**

*This is the time when, one by one, Hassan—being in distress—
lets patience, forbearance, reason, and awareness slip away.*

This couplet describes a state where conditions have grown so unbearable that the poet concludes it is time to let go. He abandons patience (once held in the hope that things might improve), forbearance (bearing calamities in expectation of relief), reason (since his suffering cannot be explained or rationalized), and awareness itself (since to be aware is to feel the pain; to become unaware would be to escape it).

This couplet thus marks a point of no return. He can no longer justify or endure his suffering, and he simply releases whatever hope he once had.

_A sher on a similar note by Jaun Elia:_

_*न हुआ नसीब क़रार-ए-जाँ हवस-ए-क़रार भी अब नहीं_
_तिरा इंतिज़ार बहुत किया तिरा इंतिज़ार भी अब नहीं*_

Ghalib also describes such a state, though in a different vein from both Mir and Jaun:

_*इशरत-ए-क़तरा है दरिया में फ़ना हो जाना_
_दर्द का हद से गुज़रना है दवा हो जाना*_

Here, Ghalib suggests that when pain passes the threshold of tolerance, it not only ceases to hurt but begins to serve as its own medicine.
