लगे ख़दंग जब उस नाला-ए-सहर का सा
फ़लक का हाल न हो क्या मिरे जिगर का सा
	- Translation:
	- When struck by the arrow of that morning cry,
	- why shouldn't the sky/heavens bleed crimson like my heart?
	- The opening line of this couplet presents a powerful paradox. The poet speaks of an **"arrow of a morning cry."** While morning is often seen as a symbol of hope and new beginnings, here it has become an instrument of terror and pain for the lover. This speaks volumes about the poet's profound state of despair, where even the most optimistic and soothing aspects of nature have turned hostile.
	- This sentiment echoes the work of other great poets. Mir, for instance, expresses a similar sense of desolation in the presence of nature's beauty:
	*- jab nasīm-e-sahar udhar jā hai*
	*- ek sannāhaTā guzar jā hai*
	- And Ghalib describes a state where suffering is so total that the line between day and night blurs completely:
	*- jise nasīb ho roz-e-siyāh merā sā*
	*- vo shaḳhs din na kahe raat ko to kyūñkar ho*
	- The second line of Momin's couplet amplifies the tragedy. The **"arrow"** has struck the poet's heart/liver (**jigar**), causing a wound so immense that the poet's suffering has a cosmic impact. He asks a rhetorical question: Why wouldn't the heavens bleed crimson just like his heart? The red hue of the morning sky is thus interpreted not as a sign of dawn's beauty, but as a visual testament to the poet's bleeding wound, a tragedy so great that the cosmos itself weeps in sympathy.
	- This flipping of the natural order is a recurring motif in poetry of this style. Instead of man submitting to the will of nature or divinity, here we see the opposite: the laws of nature are bent by the force of human emotion. The suffering of the lover is so profound that it alters the very fabric of the universe. This idea is also found in the modern poet Farhat Ehsas's verse:
	- *Ankhen barasti dekhin to badal theher gayen*
	*- ankhon ke ehteraam me barsaat rok ke*
	- The poet’s agony is not a private matter; it contains within itself the force to disturb the cosmic order. This is a powerful echo of Ghalib's couplet:
	- *'Ghalib' hameñ na chheḌ ki phir josh-e-ashk se*
	*- baiThe haiñ ham tahayya-e-tūfāñ kiye hue*
	*- (Trouble, tease me not for I, with the ardor of my tears*
	*- Await determined to unleash a storm beyond all fears)*
	- Ultimately, Momin's couplet suggests that this pain is not a one-time event, but an everyday ritual. It's as if every morning, the poet is struck anew by this "arrow," and every morning, the heavens are stained with his blood. The origin of the **"cry"** is left open to interpretation, but the most fitting is that it arises from within the poet himself, a daily lament that resonates through the universe.
