O’er the midnight moorlands crying,  
Thro’ the cypress forests sighing,  
In the night-wind madly flying,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Hellish forms with streaming hair;  
In the barren branches creaking,  
By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,  
Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Damn’d daemons of despair.  
  
Once, I think I half remember,  
Ere the grey skies of November  
Quench’d my youth’s aspiring ember,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Liv’d there such a thing as bliss;  
Skies that now are dark were beaming,  
Gold and azure, splendid seeming  
Till I learn’d it all was dreaming—  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Deadly drowsiness of Dis.  
  
But the stream of Time, swift flowing,  
Brings the torment of half-knowing—  
Dimly rushing, blindly going  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Past the never-trodden lea;  
And the voyager, repining,  
Sees the wicked death-fires shining,  
Hears the wicked petrel’s whining  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)As he helpless drifts to sea.  
  
Evil wings in ether beating;  
Vultures at the spirit eating;  
Things unseen forever fleeting  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Black against the leering sky.  
Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,  
Clawing fiends of future sadness,  
Mingle in a cloud of madness  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Ever on the soul to lie.  
  
Thus the living, lone and sobbing,  
In the throes of anguish throbbing,  
With the loathsome Furies robbing  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Night and noon of peace and rest.  
But beyond the groans and grating  
Of abhorrent Life, is waiting  
Sweet Oblivion, culminating  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)All the years of fruitless quest.
