It was golden and splendid,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That City of light;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)A vision suspended  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)In deeps of the night;  
A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I remember the season  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)It dawn’d on my gaze;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The mad time of unreason,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The brain-numbing days  
When Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and craze.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)More lovely than Zion  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)It shone in the sky,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)When the beams of Orion  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Beclouded my eye,  
Bringing sleep that was fill’d with dim mem’ries of moments obscure and gone by.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Its mansions were stately  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)With carvings made fair,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Each rising sedately  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)On terraces rare,  
And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles blossoming there.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The avenues lur’d me  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)With vistas sublime;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Tall arches assur’d me  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That once on a time  
I had wander’d in rapture beneath them, and bask’d in the Halcyon clime.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)On the plazas were standing  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)A sculptur’d array;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Long-bearded, commanding,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Grave men in their day—  
But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face batter’d away.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)In that city effulgent  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)No mortal I saw;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)But my fancy, indulgent  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)To memory’s law,  
Linger’d long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features with awe.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I fann’d the faint ember  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That glow’d in my mind,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And strove to remember  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The aeons behind;  
To rove thro’ infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin’d.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Then the horrible warning  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Upon my soul sped  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Like the ominous morning  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That rises in red,  
And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead.
