Thro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Past the wan-moon’d abysses of night,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have liv’d o’er my lives without number,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have sounded all things with my sight;  
And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have whirl’d with the earth at the dawning,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)When the sky was a vaporous flame;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have seen the dark universe yawning,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Where the black planets roll without aim;  
Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I had drifted o’er seas without ending,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Under sinister grey-clouded skies  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That the many-fork’d lightning is rending,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That resound with hysterical cries;  
With the moans of invisible daemons that out of the green waters rise.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have plung’d like a deer thro’ the arches  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Of the hoary primordial grove,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Where the oaks feel the presence that marches  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And stalks on where no spirit dares rove;  
And I flee from a thing that surrounds me, and leers thro’ dead branches above.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have stumbled by cave-ridden mountains  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That rise barren and bleak from the plain,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have drunk of the fog-foetid fountains  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That ooze down to the marsh and the main;  
And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things I care not to gaze on again.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have scann’d the vast ivy-clad palace,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have trod its untenanted hall,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Where the moon writhing up from the valleys  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Shews the tapestried things on the wall;  
Strange figures discordantly woven, which I cannot endure to recall.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have peer’d from the casement in wonder  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)At the mouldering meadows around,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)At the many-roof’d village laid under  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The curse of a grave-girdled ground;  
And from rows of white urn-carven marble I listen intently for sound.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have haunted the tombs of the ages,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I have flown on the pinions of fear  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Where the smoke-belching Erebus rages,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Where the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:  
And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I was old when the Pharaohs first mounted  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The jewel-deck’d throne by the Nile;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)I was old in those epochs uncounted  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)When I, and I only, was vile;  
And Man, yet untainted and happy, dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle.  
  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Oh, great was the sin of my spirit,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And great is the reach of its doom;  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Nor can respite be found in the tomb:  
Down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom.
