The steeples are white in the wild moonlight,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And the trees have a silver glare;  
Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And the harpies of upper air,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That flutter and laugh and stare.  
  
For the village dead to the moon outspread  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Never shone in the sunset’s gleam,  
But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Where the rivers of madness stream  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Down the gulfs to a pit of dream.  
  
A chill wind weaves thro’ the rows of sheaves  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)In the meadows that shimmer pale,  
And comes to twine where the headstones shine  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And the ghouls of the churchyard wail  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)For harvests that fly and fail.  
  
Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That tore from the past its own  
Can quicken this hour, when a spectral pow’r  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Spreads sleep o’er the cosmic throne  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And looses the vast unknown.  
  
So here again stretch the vale and plain  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)That moons long-forgotten saw,  
And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Sprung out of the tomb’s black maw  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)To shake all the world with awe.  
  
And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)The ugliness and the pest  
Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Shall some day be with the rest,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And brood with the shades unblest.  
  
Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)And the leprous spires ascend;  
For new and old alike in the fold  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)Of horror and death are penn’d,  
![](https://www.hplovecraft.com/pics/PixelClear.gif)For the hounds of Time to rend.
