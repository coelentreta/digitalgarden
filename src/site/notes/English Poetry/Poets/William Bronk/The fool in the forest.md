Descending once from an unfamiliar hill
on what we thought was the only path until 
we came to a place we never saw before 
we stopped, 
and, hesitating, took a few steps more
and stopped again.
Here, finding ourselves on unexpected ground, 
we picked some withering berries that we found,
and seeing each other in fading and sallow light, 
we counted the number of hours there were till night. 
We knew we needed once again to inure 
ourselves to a faltering world. We had been too sure
of the rightness of this path to go back now
or pretend we were wiser than the woods allow.
Weâ€™d meant to go down. At least this way led down
and led, no doubt, to some place nearer town.
