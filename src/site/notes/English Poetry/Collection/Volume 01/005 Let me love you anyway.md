Years of love have been long forgot, 
in the hatred of a minute
tell me every terrible thing that you ever did
and let me love you anyway. 

Let me glimpse inside your velvet bones
there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless
which can not be touched without emotion 
The eye like a shattered mirror,
multiplies the images of sorrow

It is a happiness to wonder
It is a happiness to dream 
Yes now i feel that it was then 
on that evening of sweet dreams

That the very first dawn of the human love
Burst upon the icy night of my spirit
since that period i have never seen or heard your name
without a shiver
half of delight
half of anxiety

Let my heart be still a moment, 
and this mystery explore

Edgar Allen Poe
